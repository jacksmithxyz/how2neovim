# Preface

Welcome to how2neovim!

Neovim is a highly customizable and extensible text editor. And although wonderful, it can sometimes be a bit confusing or daunting for newcomers to start configuring.

Itâ€™s a terminal-based application built for editing and manipulating text, and is also popular among programmers due to its large plugin ecosystem.

This book aims to be an entry point to Neovim configuration - explaining in detail how it works, and how you can configure Neovim on your own.

## What this book is not

This book is **not a copy and paste configuration for Neovim**.

It is intended to help you understand how configuration works so you can make the program your own, rather than giving you a bootstrapped system.

This book is **not a guide on how to use Vim motions**. Using Neovim and becoming productive with its many keybinds is nt in the scope of this book.

Plenty of excellent resources exist on getting proficient with Vim keybindings, and this book is instead focused purely on understanding how Neovim, as a tool/program works.
